# Welcome to Codewell! ðŸ‘‹

Codewell's aim is to provide you with real-world design templates that you can use to practice your HTML and CSS projects. 

Free or paid, all templates are high quality and will make great portfolio pieces.

### I've completed the challenge, now what?

We recommend using one of these two websites to deploy your projects

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

They're super easy to setup and you should have your website up and running in no time, just follow their instructions.


### Submit your solution to Codewell

Visit the relevant challenge on [Codewell](https://codewell.cc) and click on 'Submit Solution' right under the challenge.
Enter all the title, Github repo URL, Live URL (Netlify or GH Pages), and tell the community what challenges you've faced.

his is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
